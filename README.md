# AutoLisp-scripts

This reposity is for personal use only.
In here i store my scripts i use in Autocad to automate repetitive tasks and make life easier for the cad drawers.


##NewTifFile 
  Script to create a new dwg file with each Tiff drawing file.
  The script will search in a specified folder for all tiff files and creates a new dwg file with the same name as the tif file if there     is no such dwg file corresponding to the tif file.
  
  Sometimes it happens with a new project that there are one or multipe drawings without a Autocad DWG file. This script will save a lot of time creating new DWG files at the start of a project.
